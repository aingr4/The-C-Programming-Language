## The C Programming Language
This repository contains my attempts to solve the exercises presented in the book [The C programming Language](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/515601.The_C_Programming_Language). I also occasionally write notes or thoughts about the chapter.

I do not guarantee the correctness of any of these exercises, I am just a software engineer learning a new language.
