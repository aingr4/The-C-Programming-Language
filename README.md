## The C Programming Language
This repository contains my attempts to solve the exercises presented in the book [The C programming Language](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/515601.The_C_Programming_Language). I also occasionally write notes or thoughts about the chapter.

I do not guarantee the correctness of any of these exercises, I am just a software engineer learning a new language.

There are makefiles in each exercise folder to help you run some of the C programs. Use the following command in a Linux shell. Tested in Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
```shThis is interesting, looks like we can iterate over
       an array of unknown size by writing a while loop
make
```

Optional: Add command line arguments using the PARAMS variable
```sh
make PARAMS="SOME ARGS HERE"
```
